  abstract = {This strategy focuses on how everyone in Liverpool can work together to prevent deaths and chronic illness from cardiovascular disease (CVD) over the next decade. It will form part of the Non-Communicable Disease Prevention strategy for the city. CVD includes coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. The Liverpool Health and Wellbeing strategy aims to improve health and wellbeing and to reduce health inequalities in the city (Liverpool City Council 2014). It sets out a number of principles that are relevant to this strategy including:  building community concern for health,  a household focus,  reducing health inequalities, and  a commitment to sustainability. This strategy presents a bold paradigm shift in Liverpool: to create an environment where healthy choices are made the easier and more natural choices for everyone, especially for communities with the greatest burden of CVD. The strategy was developed by the cardiovascular disease prevention group, with input from a wide range of stakeholders at a city-wide event, held in July 2017.},
