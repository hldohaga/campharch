The COVID-19 pandemic has caused life expectancy in Liverpool in 2018 - 20 to fall to the level of a decade ago. \n    On average, men born in Liverpool can expect to live to  76.1 years while women born in Liverpool can expect to live to  79.9 years , both significantly below the England average and the 2nd lowest out of 8 core cities after Manchester. \n    The life expectancy gap at birth between the richest and poorest deciles in the city has widened to 9.1 years compared to 7.4 years before the pandemic. \n    Healthy life expectancy in Liverpool is significantly below the national average at 58.3 years in males and 57.9 years in females while the gap with England is 5 years and 6 years respectively. \n    Between 2014 and 2020, there was a steady rise in the number of deaths in 85+ year olds before falling in 2021, with numbers of deaths increasing by  20%  overall between 2014 and 2021 in that age group. \n    Healthy life expectancy at 65 years stands at 8.4 years for males and 8.3 years for females, both significantly below the national level. \n    Falls are the largest cause of emergency hospital admissions for older people, and significantly impact on long term outcomes. In 2020/21, Liverpool had the 4th highest rate in the country for falls injuries among older people, with around  2,280  emergency hospital admissions due to falls annually. \n    Hip fracture is a debilitating condition – only one in three sufferers return to their former levels of independence and one in three ends up leaving their own home and moving to long-term care. In 2020/21, there were  455  people aged 65 and over who experienced a hip fracture, significantly above national levels. \n    Latest figures show deaths among older persons aged 85 and over in the city were  8.5%  higher in the winter compared to the non-winter periods which is better than the national level ( 20.8% ). \n \nView 'Productive Healthy Ageing Profile', Public Health England \nDetailed needs assessments \n \nThe following health needs assessments have been published in relation to Liverpool’s older population: \n \n    Care homes HNA \n    Falls and fragility HNA \n    Older person HNA \n    Dementia HNA \n \nLiverpool information \n \n    Excess winter deaths \n    What we die from: All ages \n    Long term conditions and multi-morbidity \n    End of Life Intelligence Report \n \nLiverpool City Region (LCR) \n \n    Older people health and wellbeing profile December 2020 - LCR (pdf : 3.5 MB) \n \nPublic Health England profiles \n \n    Dementia profile 2017 \n    Adult social care \n \n  \n \n  \nIn this section \n \n    Back to Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA) section \n    Ageing well \n    About the JSNA \n    Our city \n    Wider determinants of health \n    Starting well \n    Developing well \n    Living well \n    Conditions and diseases \n    Specific population groups \n \nA to Z of services \n \n    a \n    b \n    c \n    d \n    e \n    f \n    g \n    h \n    i \n    j \n    k \n    l \n    m \n    n \n    o \n    p \n    q \n    r \n    s \n    t \n    u \n    v \n    w \n    x \n    y \n    z \n \nFollow us \n \n    Twitter \n    Facebook \n    Instagram \n \nUsing this site \n \n    Privacy \n    Support \n    Contact \n \n    Liverpool Express \n    Keep me posted horizontal logo \n    Just ask alexa \n \nCookie Control Icon \n"}
