Variation in the experience of wider determinants (i.e. social inequalities) is considered the fundamental cause (the ‘causes of the causes’) of health outcomes, and as such health inequalities are likely to persist through changes in disease patterns and behavioural risks so long as social inequalities persist. \nKey facts \n \n    Liverpool has the highest rate of violent crime in England, with around 622 emergency hospital admissions for violence each year. \n    In 2020/21, there were 131 children in the youth justice system (10-17 years).
