There were 4.6 infant deaths per thousand live births in 2018 - 20, which was not significantly different to the England rate ( 3.9 per 1,000 ). \n    Some 2.36% of live births at term in 2020 had a low birthweight (defined as weighing under 2500g), which was similar to 2.86% reported nationally. \n    575 (1 in 9) mothers in 2020/21 were recorded as being smokers at the time of the delivery of their baby, compared with 1 in 10 nationally. \n    58.7% of Liverpool mothers initiated breastfeeding and only 37.7% were breastfeeding 6-8 weeks after the birth of their baby (England reported figures of 67.4% and 48% respectively). \n    Vaccination coverage in 2020/21 was generally below or similar to national benchmarks. Some 90.6% of two-year-olds in the city had been vaccinated for Dtap/IPV/Hib which was below the national average ( 93.8% ). \n    Liverpool has a high rate of admissions for tooth decay in children aged 0-5 years, 2.5 times higher than England. \n    Only 64.9% of Liverpool children are ready for school at the end of their school reception year, significantly below the national level ( 71.8% ) and the 2 nd lowest in the country. \n    26.8% of our children aged 4-5 years are either overweight or obese, significantly above the national average ( 23% ). \n \nView 'Child and Maternal Health Profile â€“ Early Years', Public Health England \nDetailed needs assessments \n \nIn summer 2017 the following health needs assessments were published in relation to Early Years: \n \n    Conception to first 1,000 days HNA \n    Readiness for early learning and school HNA \n \nLiverpool information \n \n    State of child health report 2019 \n    Children and young people infographic \n    Infant mortality \n    Childhood obesity \n \nLiverpool City Region \n \n    Children and young people health and wellbeing profile 2020 - LCR (pdf : 936 KB) \n \nPublic Health England profiles \n \n    Child health profile \n    Mental health in pregnancy, the post natal period and babies \n \nUseful websites \n \n    Child and Mental Health Profiles \n \n  \nIn this section \n \n    Back to Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA) section \n    Starting well \n    About the JSNA \n    Our city \n    Wider determinants of health \n    Developing well \n    Living well \n    Conditions and diseases \n    Ageing well \n    Specific population groups \n \nA to Z of services \n \n    a \n    b \n    c \n    d \n    e \n    f \n    g \n    h \n    i \n    j \n    k \n    l \n    m \n    n \n    o \n    p \n    q \n    r \n    s \n    t \n    u \n    v \n    w \n    x \n    y \n    z \n \nFollow us \n \n    Twitter \n    Facebook \n    Instagram \n \nUsing this site \n \n    Privacy \n    Support \n    Contact \n \n    Liverpool Express \n    Keep me posted horizontal logo \n    Just ask alexa \n \nCookie Control Icon \n"}
