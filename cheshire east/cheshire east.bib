  abstract = {Introduction This policy supports the “Statutory Guidance on Joint Strategic Needs Assessments and Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategies” published by the Department of Health in March 2013. This guidance set the scope of the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA); to identify health and social care needs that can be met or affected by the local authority (Cheshire East Council) in collaboration with clinical commissioning groups (Eastern Cheshire CCG, South Cheshire CCG) or the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS England). In addition, the JSNA is a useful resource base for a wide range of partners and the public. The benefits of the JSNA include:  Facilitating partnership working by combining data and information from a range of sources including the public and service users  Combining differing professional and organisational perspectives to support a holistic view of individuals, families and communities and provide new insights  Identifying and sharing information about local community assets to support commissioners and providers in developing community resilience  Enabling commissioners to identify priorities for action based on the balance of different needs There will not be a time-bound scheduled review and refresh of all JSNA content; the creation and updating of JSNA sections will be prioritised in line with the JSNA work programme. This work programme will be developed according to the “JSNA work programme development” policy.},
